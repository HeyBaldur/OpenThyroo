            <h3>How We Use Your Data</h3>
            <p>
              How we use your personal data will depend on which Services you use, how you use those Services and the
              choices you make in your settings. We use the data that we have about you to provide and personalize our
              Services, including with the help of automated systems and inferences we make, so that our Services
              (including ads) can be more relevant and useful to you and others.
            </p>
            <h4>
              Services
            </h4>
            <p>
              Our Services allow you to stay in touch and up to date with colleagues, partners, clients, and other
              professional contacts. To do so, you can “connect” with the professionals who you choose, and who also
              wish to “connect” with you. Subject to your and their settings, when you connect with other Members, you
              will be able to search each others’ connections in order to exchange professional opportunities.
            </p>
            <p>
              We use data about you (such as your profile, profiles you have viewed or data provided through address
              book uploads or partner integrations) to help others find your profile, suggest connections for you and
              others (e.g. Members who share your contacts or job experiences) and enable you to invite others to become
              a Member and connect with you. You can also opt-in to allow us to use your precise location or proximity
              to others for certain tasks (e.g. to suggest other nearby Members for you to connect with, calculate the
              commute to a new job, or notify your connections that you are at a professional event).
            </p>
            <p>
              It is your choice whether to invite someone to our Services, send a connection request, or allow another
              Member to become your connection. When you invite someone to connect with you, your invitation will
              include your network and basic profile information (e.g., name, profile photo, job title, region). We will
              send invitation reminders to the person you invited. You can choose whether or not to share your own list
              of connections with your connections.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Services allow you to stay informed about news, events and ideas regarding professional topics you
              care about, and from professionals you respect. Our Services also allow you to improve your professional
              skills, or learn new ones. We use the data we have about you (e.g., data you provide, data we collect from
              your engagement with our Services and inferences we make from the data we have about you), to personalize
              our Services for you, such as by recommending or ranking relevant content and conversations on our
              Services. We also use the data we have about you to suggest skills you could add to your profile and
              skills that you might need to pursue your next opportunity. So, if you let us know that you are interested
              in a new skill (e.g., by watching a learning video), we will use this information to personalize content
              in your feed, suggest that you follow certain members on our site, or suggest related learning content to
              help you towards that new skill. We use your content, activity and other data, including your name and
              photo, to provide notices to your network and others. For example, subject to your settings, we may notify
              others that you have updated your profile, posted content, took a social action, used a feature, made new
              connections or were mentioned in the news.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Services allow you to collaborate with colleagues, search for potential clients, customers, partners
              and others to do business with. Our Services allow you to communicate with other Members and schedule and
              prepare meetings with them. If your settings allow, we scan messages to provide “bots” or similar tools
              that facilitate tasks such as scheduling meetings, drafting responses, summarizing messages or
              recommending next steps. Learn more.
